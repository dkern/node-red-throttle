## Install

Run the following command in your Node-RED user directory - typically `~/.node-red`:

```
npm install node-red-contrib-throttle
```


## Usage

A simple node to throttle down passed through message amount.
Just insert the throttle node in between two others, and the passed through message amount can be limited by different parameters.
Every other messages will be dropped.


### By Time

Limits the passed through messages by a given amount of time.  
**For example:** setting the node to `10 seconds` means, that only one message in ten seconds will be forwarded.


### By Period

Limits the passed through messages by a given period of time.  
**For example:** setting the node to `10 seconds` means, that all messages in the first ten seconds will be forwarded.


### By Count

Limits the passed through messages by a given count.  
**For example:** setting the node to a count of `5` means, that only every fifth message will be forwarded.


### By Block Size

Limits the passed through messages by a given block size.
The counter will be reset when a message with `msg.reset` was received.  
**For example:** setting the node to a block size of `5` means, that only the first five messages will be forwarded.


### By Reset

Will only pass through a single message, when a message with `msg.reset` was received before.


## Example Flows

Simple examples showing how to use the throttle and it's output.
